#line	ModelTrait	Agile	Agile: Direct Attacks targeting this model will miss on a Margin of Success of zero (MOS:0) or less. Area Effect attacks will hit this model on a Margin of zero or greater. A Braced model loses the benefit of Agile (See 10.2).
#line	ModelTrait	Airdrop	Airdrop: This model may deploy using the Reserve rules (See 15.1b)
#line	ModelTrait	Amphib:X	Amphibious  May add the rating of the trait to the distance that can be moved in water that is difficult terrain.
#line	ModelTrait	AMS	Anti-Missile System: This model gains a free Reroll when attacked by weapons using the Indirect or Missile categories. Friendly Models within 6” of this model also gain this Reroll.
#line	ModelTrait	ANN	Advanced Neural Net: When choosing a posture, select one Skill rating. Improve that Skill rating by 1 for the duration of the models activation.
#line	ModelTrait	APC:X	Armored Personnel Carrier:X: This model may Transport up to X Infantry Squad models. These infantry models do not have to be in the same Combat Group. Two Infantry Team models may be Transported in the place of one Infantry Squad model (See 16.3).

Any terrain less than the vertical maximum of the jump rating is ignored and no dangerous terrain tests are made for terrain that the model power boosts over.
#line	ModelTrait	Jump Jets:X	Jump Jets:X: When this model Moves it may displace vertically up to the rating of the trait each time it encounters terrain up X Height or less. This model may not end its movement on terrain that is too narrow to contain its base.

#line	ModelTrait	Shield:X	Shield:X: This model gains a +XD6 modifier to defense from attacks from the front. Attacks that ignore cover ignore this bonus. AE attacks with the primary target in this models front arc do allow the modifier.
#line	ModelTrait	Smoke:X	Smoke:X: Combat or Braced posture models with Smoke:X may use an Action to fire Smoke. Firing Smoke places a AE:3” centered on the location of the Active model. Smoke is Light Area Cover and has a height of 4”.  Each Smoke trait can be used X times per game. Remove Smoke Area Effects in the Cleanup Phase
#line	ModelTrait	Stable	Stable Weapons Platform: This model adds a +1D6 modifier to all Gunnery rolls
#line	ModelTrait	Stealth	Stealth: This model improves its Piloting skill by 1 for defense rolls against Direct and Indirect ranged attacks. This modifier does not apply when the model is using an attack action or reaction,  active sensors, an EW action, or making a Comms roll. This modifier does not apply if the model is attacked with a melee attack, or has no cover from the Observer of a Forward Observation (See 14.3). Sensor Lock against a model with the Stealth trait has a -6” modifier to the range of the Sensors.
#line	ModelTrait	TD:X	Target Designator: A TD may only be used at Combat or Braced speeds and only if the target model does not have Full Cover. A Forward Observation by a model using a Target Designator trait may use the TD trait to activate the Guided trait on weapons chained to the Forward Observation.

#line	WeaponTrait	AP:X	Armor Piercing:X: A Target with an Armor Rating higher than the Penetration Rating of the attack will suffer damage equal to the Margin of Success up to the rating of the trait, or normal damage, whichever is greater. Area Effect attacks with the AP trait only resolve the AP trait against primary targets.
#line	WeaponTrait	AS	Anti-Structure: Attack rolls targeting structures (buildings and fortifications) are resolved using normal Gunnery Skill instead of GU:6+ (See 6.9a).
#line	WeaponTrait	Auto	Automatic Fire System: The weapon system this trait is attached to may snap fire without spending an action. The attack resolves with its Gunnery skill degraded by 1.

#line	WeaponTrait	Guided	Guided: A Guided weapon that attacks a target that has been Forward Observed with a Target Designator may benefit from the Target Designator:X (TD:X) rating modifier, and does not suffer the range modifiers for attacking using the Indirect Category (See 8.2).
#line	WeaponTrait	Haywire	Haywire: This weapon uses the Haywire Special Weapon rules (See 9.6).
#line	WeaponTrait	LA:X	Limited Ammunition:X: This weapon may Attack a number of times equal to the X rating. Mark this model with a token to indicate ammunition remaining.
